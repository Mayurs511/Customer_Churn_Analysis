The telecom industry faces significant challenges in retaining customers due to high competition and evolving customer needs. The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn data to identify the key factors contributing to churn and to develop strategies that telecom companies can use to improve customer retention.

The dataset includes 6,418 records of telecom customers, with 32 attributes capturing demographic details, service usage, and financial information. Key features include Customer_ID, Age, Contract Type, Monthly_Charge, Total_Revenue, and Churn_Reason.

#### 3. Insights from Dashboards:
3.1 Churn Rates: Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts (one-year or two-year).
3.2 Service Type Impact: Fiber optic internet users show lower churn rates, whereas DSL users are more prone to switching providers.
3.3 Primary Churn Reasons: Common reasons for churn include better deals from competitors, dissatisfaction with network reliability, and issues with billing and customer service.etc

### 4.Overall Project Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that contract type, service quality, and customer support are critical factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry. By focusing on these areas, telecom companies can develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty.
